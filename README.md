Deploy the ML algorithm on the STM32 device: deploying the algorithm also includes developing the supporting
functions to receive data over BLE, perform inference, create notifications in case of anomalies and then
transmit them. The anomaly score should also be transmitted to a database (via a protocol of ).
1 npm install -g edge-impulse-cli --force
We trained the model.
Then we deploy the on STM32 microcontroller(MC).
Thee by using functions we run inference using that trained model on the STM32 MC.
